The purpose of this example is to send a MULTIPART RESPONSE from SERVER
back to CLIENT. Do note that all browsers do not behave in the same way.
On firefox, the LAST part of the response will be displayed.
<br>
TODO: You can try switching the LAST part of the response to see if the
firefox browser does indeed show the correct part.
