The purpose of this example is to show how the BROWSER sends a
multi-part request to the SERVER.
<br> We have a FORM that uses multipart/form-data encoding.
We are able to send MULTIPLE files in one request. These files can be of
different types (word/excel/text/pdf/image etc).
<br>
Do check that the response obtained from 06_display.php does indeed 
show that two files were received by the server (from the browser).
<br> <br>

<form method="post" action="06_display.php" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="file1" value="select file1"/> <br>
<input type="file" name="file2" value="select file2"/> <br>
<input type="file" name="file3" value="select file3"/> <br>
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="click to Submit"/> <br>
</form>
