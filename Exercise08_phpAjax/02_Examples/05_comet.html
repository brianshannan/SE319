The purpose of this example is to show one way to have SERVER send
data to client when it wants.
There are many ways to do this and the word COMET is used to refer to
them.
<BR>
One way is to have client poll the server frequently - to see if the
server wants to send some information. This is called short polling.
<BR>
Another way is to have client send a request to server and then keep the
connection open - until the server has some info to send back. That's a
normal http response. Then the client makes another request. This is
called long polling.
<BR>
Another way, used by this example, is called streaming. Here the server
sends back a multi-part response. Each part can be sent back when the
server is ready to send. 
<BR>
Web Sockets, which allow bi-directional communication between client and
server, is slowly replacing need for COMET techniques.
<br><br>
NOTE THAT ALL BROWSERS DO NOT BEHAVE CORRECTLY. FIREFOX works ok.
The below section will be populated by data from a separate request to
the server when we click the button. The server sends several chunks of
data one after the other.
In the meantime, clicking the second button will toggle the color of this text.
</div>
<br>
The response from the server will be put below the horizontal line.

<div id="myDiv"></div>
